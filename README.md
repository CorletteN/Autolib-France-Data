This repository is an analysis by a junior data scientist working on Autolib dataset; an electric car-sharing service company. The task is to process stations data to understand electric car usage over time by identifying the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.
Bonus: Figuring out the most popular hour for returning cars.
The repo shows how to get started on understanding datasets, upload data into the environment, cleaning the data, basic analysis and visualization.
